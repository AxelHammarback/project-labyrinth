# Project Labyrinth

By: Claudia Kjerrgren and Axel Hammarb√§ck.

Project Labyrinth is a small text-based adventure game where you need to find your way out of a labyrinth. 

## The problem

We started out by doing fetches to the API using Postman, to make sure we understood how to fetch the data we need in the game. After that, we built a small PoC, which we evolved into the end product.
Tools used: React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Figma.
